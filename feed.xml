One of the many good things about this metric is that in many cases it yields nicer gradients when compared to other divergences like the Jensen-Shannon divergence. For this reas... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Let's Count!</title><link href="https://many-facedgod.github.io/posts/lets-count/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Let's Count!" /><published>2020-04-21T13:19:00-04:00</published> <updated>2020-04-21T13:19:00-04:00</updated> <id>https://many-facedgod.github.io/posts/lets-count/</id> <content src="https://many-facedgod.github.io/posts/lets-count/" /> <author> <name>Tanmaya Shekhar Dabral</name> </author> <category term="Math" /> <summary> For the first post, let’s talk about something so innate to our intuition, that we might as well call it… natural. You guessed it, today we’ll talk about natural numbers and the rather odd notions surrounding them. The set of all natural numbers, $\mathbb{N} = \{0, 1, 2, …\}$, of course, goes on forever. If you give me a natural number, I can always produce the next one by adding $1$. And yet,... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>git init</title><link href="https://many-facedgod.github.io/posts/git-init/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="git init" /><published>2020-04-19T03:52:00-04:00</published> <updated>2020-04-19T03:52:00-04:00</updated> <id>https://many-facedgod.github.io/posts/git-init/</id> <content src="https://many-facedgod.github.io/posts/git-init/" /> <author> <name>Tanmaya Shekhar Dabral</name> </author> <category term="Meta" /> <summary> Freshly graduated with a master’s degree in computer science and basking in the newly discovered privilege of not having seventeen and a half deadlines every week, I’ve decided to try my hand at non-fiction writing about things I may or may not know a bit about. And so, this blog will serve as a dumping ground for such ramblings, with the topics potentially ranging from fine arts, math and comp... </summary> </entry> </feed>
