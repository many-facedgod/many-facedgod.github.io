I am a final year undergrad student at Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS Pilani), Hyderabad Campus, India, majoring in Computer Science. My interests span a wide range, from artificial intelligence and machine learning to creative writing and sketching. I'm particularly interested in the application of AI in natural language processing and computer vision. Recently, I have also acquired a taste for computer graphics and image processing.

# Current Projects


* [Cloth Simulation](https://github.com/many-facedgod/Energy-Based-Cloth-Simulation): Implementing Baraff & Witkin's "Large Steps in Cloth Simulation" without the assumptions mentioned in the paper.
* A sequel to [Cancer](http://blog.polyartfactory.com/2017/07/cancer.html) :)

# Past Projects


* [Bezier Curves](https://github.com/many-facedgod/Bezier-Drawing): Implemented de Casteljau's algorithm over OpenGL for as an interactive application.
* [Neuro-Evolution of Augmenting Topologies](https://github.com/many-facedgod/NEAT-RL): A python implementation of the NEAT algorithm for reinforcement learning.
* [Totem](https://github.com/many-facedgod/Totem): A library that facilitates easy neural network creation using Theano. Abandoned since the developement of Theano itself has ceased.
* [Automatic Music-Tagging](https://github.com/many-facedgod/Music-Tagger): A multi-scale CNN for music tagging, written over Totem (see above). Paper accepted into SocPros 2017. :)
* [Decision Trees, AdaBoost, Random Forests](https://github.com/many-facedgod/Decision-Trees): ID3 and a couple of ensemble methods, written in Java.
* [Relevance Propagation in Neural Networks](https://github.com/many-facedgod/Relevance-Prop): A quick implementation of Sebastian Bach's [Pixel-wise relevance propagation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4498753/) that I did overnight.
* [FP Trees](https://github.com/many-facedgod/FPTrees): A Java implementation of the FP Growth algorithm.
